# Welcome to my blog

I will be using the [Jekyll][1] theme for [@jasonlong][2]'s [Cayman theme][4] on [GitHub Pages][3], with some slight modifications (mostly aesthetic). I will leave unchanged the instructions on how to use it.

## How to use it?

Download the theme @ https://github.com/pietromenna/jekyll-cayman-theme/archive/master.zip

Unzip it and use it as a regular jekyll folder.

```
$ unzip jekyll-cayman-theme-master.zip
```

Get inside the newly extracted folder
```
$ cd jekyll-cayman-theme-master
```

Get the required gems
```
$ bundle install
```

Use it!

```
$ jekyll serve
```

For more details read about [Jekyll][1] on its web page.

## Setup

Some important configuration can be done in the file `_config.yml`. To use the Cayman theme and use Markdown, I have added the following:

```
markdown: kramdown
theme:    jekyll-theme-cayman
```
