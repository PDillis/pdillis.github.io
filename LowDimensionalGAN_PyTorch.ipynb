        "[Generative Adversarial Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) or GANs for short are, without a doubt, one of the most widely known algorithms in Machine Learning nowadays. As you have seen in the lectures, GANs are a different type of models than the ones that one typically encounters. Being from the branch of [Unsupervised Learning](https://sites.google.com/view/berkeley-cs294-158-sp20/home), they are specifically tasked with learning an *implicit* representation of the training dataset distribution $p_\\text{data}$. While a subfield of [generative modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model), they are not the only widely-used models from this field.\n",

A [**seed**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_seed) is the number that starts the pseudorandom number generator algorithm, and I am sure you have encountered it once before, either in the form [`np.random.seed(seed)`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/generated/numpy.random.seed.html) or [`random.seed(seed)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.seed), or in popular games like [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net) that require a seed to generate a world.\n",

This is because some datasets only make sense when they're upright (e.g., human faces) or cropped at specific places (such as the center of the image). However, this also depends on your dataset, so don't let me stop you from trying other approaches.

        "However, there is a caveat noted in the original GAN paper and further discussed in the [NeurIPS 2016 Tutorial on GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00160): we can see that at the beginning fo training, the distribution of the generated data will be *very* different to the real data, so the Discriminator will have an easy task as it won't have much problem distinguishing between the two of them. Therefore, $D\\circ G(z)$ will be small, and hence the signal for the Generator won't be enough to update its weights significantly. In other words, the minimax game **saturates** quickly, causing the gradients to **vanish**.\n",

In it, the authors set the latent dimension to `nz=100`, so if you set `nz=1` for example, you are more than likely to get mode collapse."

A final point is that the IS should be calculated usinig a high number of generated images such as $50,000$ as noted by [Salimans-et-al, 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498).\n",

See the Figures 1 and 2 of their paper."
