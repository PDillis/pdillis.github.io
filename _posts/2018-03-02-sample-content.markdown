Welcome! 

This is my first ever introduction to making a Github website via Github Pages (first time making a website for that matter), so this will be a long but fun learning process. 

Hopefully, I can share both the ideas I have, as well as what I have learned throughout the projects I have done in the past and plan to do in the future. Speaking of, the three exciting things coming in the following weeks are:

1. I will be finishing [Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/). All that is left now are entering the Quizes, as I was auditing the courses, but overall this specialization has greatly improved my understanding of Deep Neural Networks, and I highly recommend it to anyone new in the area that is struggling (as I believe is the case for the majority of newcomers). Likewise, it has inspired me to pursue more projects (of which I will soon post the full list of ideas I've had during the course as well as before), but also to finish/polish the ones I have already started.

2. Start [42's Piscine](https://www.42.us.org/program/intensive-basic-training/) mid-March, where I aim to gain a better understanding of coding as a whole, as well as recovering the discipline to self-learn. I will be uploading all that I code and learn during this month of intensive coding to my Github page, but will post here an executive summary of this exciting event. Hopefully I will be accepted to the full program after the Piscine is done!

3. Attend the upcoming [DIY Robocards](https://diyrobocars.com/) [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/DIYRobocars/) to both find inspiration by actually witnessing at what the open sourced community is actually doing, as well as to get tips on how to do build my own self-driving robocar when I return to Guatemala on April. There are several options for this, but the one I have chosen is the [Donkey self-driving car](https://github.com/openmv/openmv-projects/blob/master/donkey-car/README.md).

I am new to the world of Deep Learning and Machine Learning in general, having just started in May of last year via my internship in the [Computer Vision Center](http://www.cvc.uab.es/) as a final project/thesis for my [Master's degree](http://www.mathmods.eu/). I will expand more on this subject on a later post, but the experience has introduced me to the exciting and fascinating world of AI and Machine Learning.

See you soon!
