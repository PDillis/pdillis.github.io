This blog post will be short, I have a few announcements:

# Ph.D.

I've started a [Ph.D. in Computer Science](https://www.uab.cat/web/postgrado/doctorados/todos-los-doctorados/informacion-general/informatica-1345467765424.html?param2=1345657891663) at the Autonomous University of Barcelona ([UAB](https://www.uab.cat/))! Specifically I will be doing my research at the [Computer Vision Center](http://www.cvc.uab.es/), in the research group of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems or [ADAS](http://adas.cvc.uab.es/), under the guidance of [Dr. Antonio López Peña](http://www.cvc.uab.es/~antonio/). I am excited to be a part of both this research group and the CVC, and know that I will learn a lot from them!

# Threads

Threads (2019) is a continuation of [Latent Fabrics (2018)](http://www.aiartonline.com/community/diego-porres/) and as such, wishes to explore the similarities in the latent space of the threads of different cultures in Guatemala and Mexico. I focused now on the details of the different threads used in different regions, and over 3000 images where obtained from online and private collections.

However, I didn't wish to simply resize each image, so I cut different square regions of each image, resulting in exactly 11852 square images which I then fed to a [ProGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196). The image sizes varied, but some had to be resized and I decided to start with images of size $128\times128$.

A small interpolation video has been generated after ~10 days of training on a burrowed [GTX 1080](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/products/10series/geforce-gtx-1080/). In total, the Discriminator saw around 12 million images, which would not have been possible, in the same timeframe, with e.g. [DCGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434).

This work couldn't have been possible without me burrowing images/getting help from:

  * Karen Elwell's [Flickr collection](https://www.flickr.com/photos/citlali/) 
  * [Huipils.com](http://www.huipils.com/) by David and Sally Hamilton
  * The [Minneapolis Institute of Art](https://new.artsmia.org/)
  * The [Museum of World Culture](http://www.varldskulturmuseerna.se/en/varldskulturmuseet/) (to be used further on)
  * The [Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture](https://www.burkemuseum.org/)
  * The [British Museum](https://www.britishmuseum.org)
  * The [National Museum of Ethnology](https://www.volkenkunde.nl/en/about-volkenkunde) (to be used further on)

As always, leave a like/comment and hopefully I'll be able to continue writing more blog posts.

Cheers!
