After a month of blood, sweat and tears (usually all three in the form of code), I have emerged victorious from the [42 Piscine!](https://www.42.us.org/program/intensive-basic-training/). Victorious from meeting amazingly talented and kind people, making new friends, learning more than I have ever learned in a month, and gaining much-needed confidence in my coding skills. I must also add one last piece of excitement: I got accepted!

While not my original end goal, there are many different paths to take during life as a 42 Cadet, which makes their offer very hard to say no to! The constant flow of speakers like [Deon Nicholas](https://angel.co/deon-nicholas) from [Forethought AI](https://www.forethought.ai/) and [Jane Herrmina](https://twitter.com/janeherriman) presenting [Julia](https://www.juliabox.com/), combined with the presence of students pushing themselves forward, is the perfect recipe for success. It is not to be taken lightly, and now I do wish to become a part of the 42 school.

If you are curious, you can find (almost) all the code I generated, along with a bit more information of the Piscine in [my Github](https://github.com/PDillis/42SiliconValley). If you plan to attend any future Piscine, ignore the code and just go with a clean mind; it's for the best. Else, know that most of the coding was done in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), but on the first days there was some [Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) scripting, which I found to be extremely insightful.

Without further ado, I leave you with some pictures I managed to take during this month of coding (some pictures have secret hidden links):

In the next post, I plan to show how to create a chatbot with Python, so stay tuned!
