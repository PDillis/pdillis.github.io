Gatekeeping art is, perhaps, one of the things I dislike the most, and one thing I am certainly guilty of doing before (as I am sure most artist have done once in their lives). In a nutshell, this mindset is as follows: nothing is *art* but what I create and enjoy, and as a corollary, there aren't quality artists nowadays, except for me and the artists whose work I enjoy.
