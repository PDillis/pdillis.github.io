[Gatekeeping](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatekeeping/) art is, perhaps, one of the things I dislike the most, and one thing I am certainly guilty of doing before (as I am sure most artist have done once in their lives). In a nutshell, this mindset is as follows: nothing is *art* but what I create and enjoy, and as a corollary, there aren't quality artists nowadays, except for me and the artists whose work I enjoy. Indeed, I believe this not only applies to artists, but to almost everyone, as art is an integral part of our lives: form criticizing nowadays music, to not enjoying superhero movies or even looking down at the No. 1 New York Times bestselling book.

Of course, there is a counterpoint to this. [Mario Vargas Llosa](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/2010/vargas_llosa/biographical/) writes in his book [Notes on the Death of Culture](https://www.amazon.com/Notes-Death-Culture-Spectacle-Society/dp/1250094747):

> > La literatura *light*, como el cine *light* y el arte *light*, da la impresión cómoda al lector y al espectador de ser culto, revolucionario, moderno y de estar a la vanguardia, con un mínimo esfuerzo intelectual.

In other words, culture and art has been shifting towards a *light* verison, one in which works of art aren't meant to be thought-provoking or profound, their only goal is to entertain. In turn, this will forces artists to never leave the known confort zone of art that sells. Indeed, this is notorious in music and cinema, where very few writers venture outside what the studios and producers dictate them to do. 

While it is true that this happens, I think that the only difference between art nowadays and classical art is that the sheer number of artists and generated art nowadays is vastly greater in numbers than before. Therefore, we are bound to see repetitveness, the same movie tropes and the same lyrics/beats in music, but this does not mean that you cannot find *quality* art, you just have to look harder to distinguish it from the noise (of course, this is all still very subjective in my opinion).

Thus, the advent of computers will only aid in further expanding this rift separating what many percieve as good or bad art, even what is and isn't art. Of course, there have been some controversial papers on this subject ([perhaps moreso how they are reported](https://hyperallergic.com/391059/humans-prefer-computer-generated-paintings-to-those-at-art-basel/)). In any case, computers, machines, and software is here to stay, and will most definitely influence something as elevated as art.
