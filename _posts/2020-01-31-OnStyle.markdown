* [StyleGAN](#stylegan)
    - [Progressive Growing](#progan)
* [StyleGAN2](#stylegan2)


# Getting Started

It is no surprise that a lot of computing power will be needed to generate large generated images.

Should only technical users be able to have fun with new emerging technologies? Most likely this will be the case in the beginning, but this will for sure change as we slowly mature both the algorithms and necessary technologies in order to access to these. Likewise, the necessary resources required not only for research but for [reproducing some of the results](https://github.com/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch) are, quite frankly, impossible for many.

# StyleGAN

While there is always need for more understanding of what the StyleGAN is truly doing[^faceediting] [^image2stylegan],



<a name="progan"></a>
## Progressive Growing

First, we must start with the base architecture of the StyleGAN: the [ProGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196). This architecture led to astounding results

# On Threads

On [The Source of Creativity](https://choice.npr.org/index.html?origin=https://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/351538855/the-source-of-creativity), Sting defines

> ...the ability to take a risk: put yourself on the line and risk ridicule, be pilloried, criticized.
> You have an idea that you wish to put out there, and you want to take the risk.

But how to apply all of this to a concrete project? While we can of course download the pretrained models done by the official authors, it is also fun to try our own experiments and monumentally fail at every step of the way, until we achieve something that captivates our eyes.

As [Helena Sarin notes](https://twitter.com/glagolista/status/1200819679209627648?s=20), a gut feeling is still needed whenever deciding if a generated image, video or work is truly worth sharing, and Threads is no


At the end, while the work I present here is certainly beautiful, I still am far more enamored with what I've [previously generated](https://blog.diegoporres.com/main/2019/07/17/UnsupervisingArt/) with ~~*lower class*~~ not state-of-the-art GANs[^dcgan]. [Bigger GANs](https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/11/14/helena-sarin-why-bigger-isnt-always-better-with-gans-and-ai-art) or better algorithms won't necessarily bring forth what we wish to express, but they should be explored in order to determine firsthand if what they capture in their latent space is close to what we wish to convey.

# StyleGAN2

Not surprisingly, [NVIDIA has released StyleGAN2[^sgan2]](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2)

When the code was first released, I was getting the error:

```
error: #error "C++ versions less than C++11 are not supported."
```

even after passing the test of whether or not [NVCC](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-compiler-driver-nvcc/index.html) was correctly installed (a true nightmare, since this isn't just an error on incompatible Python libraries, it was an error due to the [custom `TensorFlow` ops developed by the authors](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2#requirements)). Thankfully, after the end of year break, some issues were resolved and I could run the code in my PC. The problem was running it in larger GPU cards that thankfully I have access to in the [CVC](http://www.cvc.uab.es/)'s servers. There, I ran into the same issue, even with the latest push to the GitHub repo.

Luckily, there is a [quick fix](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59368180) by modifying the `nvcc` call in [line 64](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2/blob/7d3145d23013607b987db30736f89fb1d3e10fad/dnnlib/tflib/custom_ops.py#L64) in `dnnlib/tflib/custom_ops.py`. Albeit not pretty, it will let us run the code, so there's no complaints from me:

```python
cmd = 'nvcc --std=c++11 -DNDEBUG ' + opts.strip()
```

## On Transfer Learning

Perhaps the most exciting news is that [transfer learning](https://www.gwern.net/Faces#transfer-learning) is still possible in StyleGAN2. This will greatly reduce your training time, but most importantly, deliver you with quality images in the desired resolution in a matter of days (less than 1 day even as was my case).

Another key requirement, GPUs with at least 16 GB of RAM, is also unobtainable. This can be avoided by modifying the minibatch size in [`run_training.py`](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2/blob/master/run_training.py), specifically, lines [54](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2/blob/4874628c7dfffaae01f89558c476842b475f54d5/run_training.py#L54) and[90](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2/blob/4874628c7dfffaae01f89558c476842b475f54d5/run_training.py#L90). Depending on the available GPU you have, you might wish to test different numbers, but know that for me to use the [$512^2$ LSUN Car](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yanUI9m4b4PWzR0eurKNq6JR1Bbfbh6L) on a [GeForce GTX 1080](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/products/10series/geforce-gtx-1080/), I had to modify said lines accordingly:





## Training

Before starting training, you must change the following lines:

```

I particularly don't care about the usual metrics, such as the [Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID)](https://nealjean.com/ml/frechet-inception-distance/), so we will turn this off, especially since they usually take a long time to compute. The general command to use is as follows:

```
python run_training.py --num-gpus=1 --data-dir=/path/to/datasets/root/ \
	  --dataset=nameofyourdataset --config=config-f --mirror-augment=true \
	  --metrics=none
```

so the only thing to change is your `--data-dir` (which in my case was simply `./datasets/`) and your `--dataset`. In other words, if your
