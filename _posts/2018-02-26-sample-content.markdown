You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name):
  print("Hi, " + name)
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom'.
{% endhighlight %}

Trying the Markdown: $$x^2+y^2 = z^2$$
